#  G-BLASTN  

G-BLASTN is a GPU-accelerated nucleotide alignment tool based on the widely used NCBI-BLAST. 
G-BLASTN can produce exactly the same results as NCBI-BLAST, and it also has very similar user 
commands. It also supports a pipeline mode, which can fully utilize the GPU and CPU resources 
when handling a batch of queries. G-BLASTN supports megablast and blastn mode. The discontiguous
megablast mode is currently not supported.
