    for fast overlap and containment tests. 
    
    Tree nodes contain a left subtree (containing HSPs whose query
    offsets all lie in the left half of the region described by an
    internal node), a right subtree, and a midpoint list. This last
    contains all HSPs whose query offsets would lie in both subtrees.
 
    For each non-leaf node, the midpoint list for query offsets is 
    itself organized as an interval tree (the "midpoint tree"), this 
    time indexing subject offsets. In this way the subject offsets act 
    as tiebreakers for the query offsets. HSPs in a given midpoint tree
