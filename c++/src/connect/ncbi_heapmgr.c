 * Author:  Anton Lavrentiev
 *
 * Abstract:
 *
 * This is a simple heap manager with a primitive garbage collection.
 * The heap contains blocks of data, stored in a common contiguous pool,
 * each block preceded with a SHEAP_Block structure.  Low word of 'flag'
 * is either non-zero (True), when the block is in use, or zero (False),
 * when the block is vacant.  'Size' shows the length of the block in bytes,
 * (uninterpreted) data field of which is extended past the header
 * (the header size IS counted in the size of the block).
 *
 * When 'HEAP_Alloc' is called, the return value is either a heap pointer,
 * which points to the block header, marked as allocated and guaranteed
 * to have enough space to hold the requested data size; or 0 meaning, that the
 * heap has no more room to provide such a block (reasons for that:
 * heap is corrupt, heap has no provision to be expanded, expansion failed,
 * or the heap was attached read-only).
 *
 * An application program can then use the data field on its need,
 * providing not to overcome the size limit.  The current block header
 * can be used to find the next heap block with the use of 'size' member
 * (note, however, some restrictions below).
 *
 * The application program is NOT assumed to keep the returned block pointer,
 * as the garbage collection can occur on the next allocation attempt,
 * thus making any heap pointers invalid.  Instead, the application program
 * can keep track of the heap base (header of the very first heap block -
 * see 'HEAP_Create'), and the size of the heap, and can traverse the heap by
 * this means, or with call to 'HEAP_Walk' (described below). 
 *
 * While traversing, if the block found is no longer needed, it can be freed
 * with 'HEAP_Free' call, supplying the address of the block header
 * as an argument.
 *
 * Prior to the heap use, the initialization is required, which comprises
 * call to either 'HEAP_Create' or 'HEAP_Attach' with the information about
 * the base heap pointer.  'HEAP_Create' also takes the size of initial
 * heap area (if there is one), and size of chunk (usually, a page size)
 * to be used in heap expansions (defaults to alignment if provided as 0).
 * Additionally (but not compulsory) the application program can provide
 * heap manager with 'resize' routine, which is supposed to be called,
 * when no more room is available in the heap, or the heap has not been
 * preallocated (base = 0 in 'HEAP_Create'), and given the arguments:
 * - current heap base address (or 0 if this is the very first heap alloc),
 * - new required heap size (or 0 if this is the last call to deallocate
 * the entire heap). 
 * If successful, the resize routine must return the new heap base
 * address (if any) of expanded heap area, and where the exact copy of
 * the current heap is made.
 *
 * Note that all heap base pointers must be aligned on a 'double' boundary.
 * Please also be warned not to store pointers to the heap area, as a
 * garbage collection can clobber them.  Within a block, however,
 * it is possible to use local pointers (offsets), which remain same
 * regardless of garbage collections.
 *
 * For automatic traverse purposes there is a 'HEAP_Walk' call, which returns
 * the next block (either free, or used) from the heap.  Given a NULL-pointer,
 * this function returns the very first block, whereas all subsequent calls
 * with the argument being the last observed block results in the next block 
 * returned.  NULL comes back when no more blocks exist in the heap.
 *
 * Note that for proper heap operations, no allocation(s) should happen between
 * successive calls to 'HEAP_Walk', whereas deallocation of the seen block
 * is okay.
 *
 * Explicit heap traversing should not overcome the heap limit,
 * as any information outside is not maintained by the heap manager.
 * Every heap operation guarantees that there are no adjacent free blocks,
 * only used blocks can follow each other sequentially.
 *
 * To discontinue to use the heap, 'HEAP_Destroy' or 'HEAP_Detach' can be
 * called.  The former deallocates the heap (by means of a call to 'resize'),
 * the latter just removes the heap handle, retaining the heap data intact.
 * Later, such a heap can be used again if attached with 'HEAP_Attach'.
 *
 * Note that an attached heap is always in read-only mode, that is nothing
 * can be allocated and/or freed in that heap, as well as an attempt to call
 * 'HEAP_Destroy' will not actually touch any heap data (but to destroy
 * the handle only).
 *
 * Note also, that 'HEAP_Create' always does heap reset, that is the
 * memory area pointed to by 'base' (if not 0) gets reformatted and lose
 * all previous contents.
