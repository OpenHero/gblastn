/** Create an iterator for sequential server lookup.
 * @note 'nbo' in comments denotes parameters coming in network byte order;
 *       'hbo' stands for 'host byte order'.
 * @param service
 *  A service name, may not be NULL or empty.
 * @param types
 *  A bitset of type(s) of servers requested.
 * @param preferred_host
 *  Preferred host to use the service at, nbo.
 * @param net_info
 *  Connection information (NULL prevents use of the network dispatching).
 * @note If "net_info" is NULL, only LOCAL/LBSMD mappers will be consulted.
 *       If "net_info" is not NULL, LOCAL/LBSMD are consulted first,
 *       and then DISPD is consulted last (using the connection information
 *       provided) but only if mapping with LOCAL/LBSMD (if any occurred) has
 *       failed.
 * @note The registry section [CONN], keys LOCAL_DISABLE, LBSMD_DISABLE, and
 *       DISPD_DISABLE (which can be overridden by the environment variables
 *       CONN_LOCAL_DISABLE, CONN_LBSMD_DISABLE, and CONN_DISPD_DISABLE,
 *       respectively) can be used to skip the corresponding service mappers.
 *       This scheme permits to use any combination of the service mappers
 *       (local/lbsmd/network-based).
 * @note If "net_info" is not NULL then a non-zero value of
 *       "net_info->stateless" forces "types" to get the "fSERV_StatelessOnly"
 *       bit set implicitly.
 * @param skip
 *  An array of servers NOT to select: contains server-info elements that are
 *  not to return from the search (whose server-infos match the would-be
 *  result).
 * @note However, special additional rules apply to the "skip" elements when
 *       the fSERV_ReverseDns bit is set in the "types":  the result-to-be is
 *       not considered if either
 *    1. There is an fSERV_Dns type entry found in "skip" that matches
 *       host[:port] (any port if 0); or
 *    2. The reverse lookup of the host:port turns up an fSERV_Dns type server
 *       whose name matches an fSERV_Dns type server from "skip".
 * @param n_skip
 *  Number of entries in the "skip" array.
 * @return
 *  Non-NULL iterator, or NULL if the service does not exist.
 * @note
 *  Non-NULL iterator does not guarantee the service operational, it merely
 *  acknowledges the service existence.
